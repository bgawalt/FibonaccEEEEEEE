# FibonaccEEEEEE

Darius "[@tinysubversions](https://twitter.com/tinysubversions)" Kazemi made a Mastodon instance where you're only allowed to use the letter "e".  It's called [dolphin.town](http://dolphin.town).

This is a bot that posts the Fibonacci sequence to dolphin.town, one new number
per day. Except numerals aren't allowed, only "e" or "E" (and punctuation).  So
I'm gonna use those two characters as binary digits.  "e" is zero, cuz it's the
small one.

Thanks much to Lorenz "[@halcy](https://twitter.com/halcy)" Diener for [Mastodon.py!](https://github.com/halcy/Mastodon.py)
